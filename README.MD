This Sponge plugin also requires the [BCLForge mod](https://github.com/KasperFranz/BCLForgeLib) which is used to save the chunks and make them loaded.

## Support

## Known issues
the database is NOT compatible with the 1.7 version of this mod, since this is making the table readable instead of being bytes - Sorry


If you have any issues with it please make an issue.
